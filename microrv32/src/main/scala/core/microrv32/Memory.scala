  /*
   * A short explanation of what is going on in this memory that is different from a trivial/naive memory implementation:
   * The specification of RISC-V states in section 1.4 Memory: 
   *        "A RISC-V hart has a single byte-addressable address space of 2XLEN bytes for all memory accesses."
   * This leaves a lot of space for implementation details of the memory used for a RISC-V hart.
   * We could have easily taken an existing memory implementation (in Verilog/VHDL) with a similar bus interface as the SimpleBus,
   * add and bind it to SpinalHDL for usage purpose. This way we could have had a byte-addessable memory. 
   * E.g. see the existing AGRA riscv-core (verilog) or the picorv32 + picosoc from Clifford Wolf
   * 
   * The states examples show two different approaches to implementing a memory: 8-bit width, 32-bit width memory
   * The 8-bit width shows an advantage when it comes to addressing the memory space, simply because you can 
   * directly use the asserted address from the bus. It similarly comes with a disadvantage (especially
   * when writing the memory in a language like SpinalHDL which generates HDL code for you) that it
   * is not very predictable if the memory can be synthesized or not.
   * 
   * The 32-bit width shows an advantage at first when it comes to implementing: you write it down as is.
   * One write and one read statement, some masks and the enable. It leaves you with a disadvantage aswell:
   * Making the memory byte-addressable is not trivial. You have to take care about the granularities yourself,
   * if the RISC-V hart does not take care of it (which doesnt have to be the case regarding the specification).
   * You can see this happening with Clifford Wolfs picorv32. There he uses a similar but not same memory interface,
   * having a write-strobe signal to choose which of the bytes are being written to.
   * Another way for this core would have been to take care partly in the core (aligning the bytes to the position) and partly
   * choosing the correct write/read mask.
   * 
   * In order to collect all the logic for byte-addressing granularity at one place we choose to translate the information from the bus
   * to infer where and what to write/read from the memory.
   * Basically it boils down to multiplexing additional signals to align the bytes properly.
   */
   
   /*
   * Generally the first step is to translate the address into an internal address with which we can access the mem-primitive.
   * For a read we need to buffer one clock cycle as they get applied for the read (which happens to be valid after 1 cycle).
   * We read the ram at the internal address: it is the external address, bit-extracted the log2(wordCount) bottom bits, divided by 4
   * The division with 4 causes our byte-adressing granularity to disappear (due to integer division). 
   * From the size and the lowest 2 bits we can recover the information which of the four bytes (as one word is 32-bit) we read
   * is the one that is requested by the RISC-V hart.
   * Bits 1 and 0 from the address give us the requested byte, the size tells us the granularity. 
   * With this information we choose the correct byte and put it onto the rdata of the bus when ready is asserted.

  /*
   * Similarly to read, if we write into the memory, we need to figure out the granularity and choose the correct byte.
   * Since we want proper SpinalHDL synthesizable memory we also need to choose the correct write-mask that gets applied.
   * Since the hart assumes a byte-addressable memory space it will align its write data from the LSB.
   * This is not the way we can write it into memory, as usually it would write into the wrong place.
   * So additionally we need to shift the data into the correct position.
