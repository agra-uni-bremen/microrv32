Executing one specific benchmark:

$ make sim_split simROM="sw/embench-split-prebuilt/slre/slre"


1. Execute all benchmarks (takes some time!):

$ ./runEmbenchSplit.sh


2. Extract all simulation.log for benchmarks into summary.log:

$ ./extractLogs.sh 

3. Then move sw/embench-split-prebuilt/summary.log to a new location and rename it.si
